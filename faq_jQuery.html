			<div class="quest">What is PHP?</div>
			<div class="answ">

			<div class="quest">What does PHP stand for?</div>
			<div class="answ">

		<div class="faqItem" id="running-concurent">
			<div class="quest">Can I run several versions of PHP at the same time?</div>
			<div class="answ">

		<div class="faqItem" id="bug">
			<div class="quest">I think I found a bug! Who should I tell?</div>
			<div class="answ">
				<p>You should go to the PHP Bug Database and make sure the bug isn't a known bug. If you don't see it in the database, use the reporting form to report the bug. It is important to use the bug database instead of just sending an email to one of the mailing lists because the bug will have a tracking number assigned and it will then be possible for you to go back later and check on the status of the bug. The bug database can be found at » http://bugs.php.net/.</p>
